   <p>Welcome to my github.io personal homepage! My name is Jackson Visser and I am a senior at the University of Puget Sound
      in Tacoma, WA. Currently I am pursuing a BA in Politics & Government with a minor in Computer Science. I grew up in nearby Seattle and am proud to say that I have lived in the beautiful Pacific Northwest for almost my entire life! </p>
   <p>Academically, I am interested in politics and the law, specifically the ways they intersect in the American context. I am also passionate about computer science and ideally I would like to pursue a career that touches on all these areas. For example, over winter
   break this year I plan to code a Discord bot that provides easy to access and visually interesting information about the United States 
   Supreme Court.</p>
   <p>Outside of academics, I also work part-time in the dining hall.
      In my spare time, I enjoy reading, listening to underground hip-hop, and playing <a href="https://youtu.be/MJkzKNReMH4" target="_blank"> Mario Kart Wii.</a></p>
